# Neighbourhood Map React Project
This is a Udacity project that shows a map of Egypt with famous locations to visit there. It has the functionality of filtering locations on both map and list. It uses [Mapbox GL JS API](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map#setzoomhttps://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map#setzoom) and fetches data from [Wikimedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page).

## _Installing_
Do the following steps:
1. Download the zipped folder
2. Unzip it
3. In a terminal, install the required dependencies by running `npm install` then run `npm start` to start the server (You should have node.js and npm installed)
4. The server will open in the browser and that's it (On port 3001)

#### _Note:_ 
The service worker and caching (Offline mode) will only work in the production mode (See next section on how to get there)

## _Run app in Production Mode_
1. Run in a terminal this command `npm run build`
2. Then install serve dependency by running `npm install -g serve`
3. Finally run `serve -s build`
